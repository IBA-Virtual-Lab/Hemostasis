# Ignore everything in this directory
*

# Always include the .gitignore file itself
!.gitignore

# But don't ignore directories themselves
!*/

# Now, explicitly un-ignore the directories you want to track.
# Add your desired directories below, one per line.
# Example:
!Assets/
!Assets/**
!ProjectSettings/
!ProjectSettings/**
!Packages/
!Packages/ **

#!my_important_feature_module/
#!src/
#!docs/
#!config/
#!tests/

# If you want to un-ignore specific files within an un-ignored directory,
# you don't need to do anything special, as the directory itself is now tracked.
# However, if you have a specific file type within an un-ignored directory
# that you *still* want to ignore, you can add it here.
# Example (if 'src/' is un-ignored, but you want to ignore all '.log' files within it):
# src/**/*.log

# If you want to un-ignore a specific file directly in the root,
# you would list it like this:
#!important_root_file.txt
