# Hemostasis Virtual Laboratory Platform

As one component of a project aiming to develop novel digital twin-based methods for biomedical laboratory science education, a virtual laboratory for hemostasis and hematology experiments is implemented in Unity3D. Source code is provided in ["Platform"](https://github.com/IBA-Virtual-Lab/Hemostasis/tree/main/Platform), while a publicly accessible implementation is hosted at http://ibalearninglab.ddns.net/LearningLab/

Coding of student feedback on an intial release using NVivo is analyzed in ["Analysis"](https://github.com/IBA-Virtual-Lab/Hemostasis/tree/main/Analysis).
