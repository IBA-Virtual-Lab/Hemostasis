# Hemostasis Virtual Laboratory Platform

As one component of a project aiming to develop novel digital twin-based methods for biomedical laboratory science education, a virtual laboratory for hemostasis and hematology experiments is implemented in Unity3D. 

* ["Platform"](https://github.com/IBA-Virtual-Lab/Hemostasis/tree/main/Platform) provides the source code for the Unity application. A publicly accessible web implementation is hosted at [ibalearninglab.ddns.net/LearningLab/](http://ibalearninglab.ddns.net/LearningLab/)
* ["Analysis"](https://github.com/IBA-Virtual-Lab/Hemostasis/tree/main/Analysis) contains Python scripts for analysis of student feedback on the intial release version, including post-processing of qualitative analysis conducted with a commercially distributed program, NVivo.
